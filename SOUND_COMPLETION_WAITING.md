# Sound Completion Waiting System

## Problem
During large chain merges, multiple sounds would overlap and create audio glitches, making the experience unpredictable and unpleasant.

## Solution
Implemented a sound completion tracking system that ensures each sound finishes before the next one starts in chain reactions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Sound Completion Tracking**
- **Active Sounds Set**: Tracks currently playing sounds
- **Completion Promises**: Maps sound types to their completion promises
- **Duration Estimation**: Estimates sound duration for proper cleanup

### 2. **Wait Mechanisms**
- **waitForSoundCompletion(soundType)**: Waits for specific sound to complete
- **waitForAllSoundsToComplete()**: Waits for all active sounds to finish
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Removes completed sounds from tracking

### 3. **Chain Merge Synchronization**
- **Pre-merge Waiting**: Waits for previous merge sounds before starting new ones
- **Sound Duration Mapping**: 
  - Merge sound: 300ms
  - Intermediate merge: 200ms
  - Drop sound: 150ms
  - Game over: 2000ms
  - Pause/resume: 100ms

## Implementation Details

### SoundManager Enhancements
```javascript
// New properties
this.activeSounds = new Set();
this.soundCompletionPromises = new Map();

// New methods
async waitForSoundCompletion(soundType)
async waitForAllSoundsToComplete()
getSoundDuration(soundType)
```

### GameLogic Integration
```javascript
// Wait for previous merge sounds before starting new chain reaction
if (chainReactionCount > 0) {
  await soundManager.waitForSoundCompletion('intermediateMerge');
}

// Wait for active sounds before playing new ones
await soundManager.waitForSoundCompletion('intermediateMerge');
await soundManager.waitForSoundCompletion('merge');
```

## Benefits

1. **No Sound Overlaps**: Each sound completes before the next starts
2. **Predictable Audio**: Consistent timing for all chain reactions
3. **Better User Experience**: Clear audio feedback without glitches
4. **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead with efficient tracking

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Large Chain Reactions**: Test with 4+ consecutive merges
2. **Rapid Merges**: Verify no sound overlaps during fast chains
3. **Mixed Sound Types**: Ensure merge and intermediate sounds don't conflict
4. **Edge Cases**: Test with very long chains and rapid user input

## Configuration

The system automatically handles:
- Sound duration estimation
- Completion promise management
- Active sound tracking
- Automatic cleanup

No additional configuration needed - the system works transparently with existing sound calls.
