## Expected Log Flow

When a drop sound is triggered, you should now see this sequence:

```
🔧 OptimizedSoundManager: Starting initialization...
🔧 Setting audio mode...
✅ Audio mode set successfully
🔧 Creating audio players...
🔧 Creating merge player...
🔧 Creating intermediate merge player...
🔧 Creating drop player...
🔧 Creating game over player...
🔧 Audio players created: { mergePlayer: true, intermediateMergePlayer: true, dropPlayer: true, gameOverPlayer: true }
✅ OptimizedSoundManager: Audio players created successfully
✅ OptimizedSoundManager: Audio initialization completed
✅ Final state: { isInitialized: true, isWebPlatform: false, hasDropPlayer: true, hasMergePlayer: true }

🔊 vibrateOnTouch called - Debug Info: { soundEnabled: true, forcePlay: true, ... }
🎵 About to call soundManager.playDropSound with forcePlay: true
🎵 playDropSound called: { forcePlay: true, isInitialized: true, isWebPlatform: false }
🎵 Force playing drop sound for important tile landing
🎵 playSoundDirectly called for drop
📊 Active sounds after adding drop: ['drop']
🎵 Calling specific play method for drop...
🎵 playDropSoundDirectly called: { isWebPlatform: false, hasDropPlayer: true, dropPlayer: [object] }
🎵 Seeking drop player to position 0...
🎵 Playing drop sound...
🎵 Drop sound play result: [play result object]
🎵 Drop sound status: [status object]
✅ Drop sound is playing successfully
✅ Force play drop sound completed successfully

```

## What to Look For

### **If Drop Sound Still Doesn't Play, Check For:**

1. **Initialization Issues:**
   - `❌ createAudioPlayers SKIPPED - web platform or no createAudioPlayer`
   - `❌ OptimizedSoundManager: Failed to create audio players:`

2. **Player Creation Issues:**
   - `❌ playDropSoundDirectly SKIPPED - no drop player`
   - Missing `🔧 Creating drop player...` log

3. **Play Method Issues:**
   - `❌ playDropSoundDirectly failed:`
   - `⚠️ Drop sound isPlaying is false - API issue`

4. **Force Play Issues:**
   - `❌ playDropSound SKIPPED - not initialized or web platform`
   - `❌ Force play drop sound failed:`

5. **Vibration System Issues:**
   - `❌ Failed to play drop sound:` with stack trace

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the app** to clear cache and use updated logging
2. **Trigger a tile drop** and watch the logs
3. **Look for any error messages** or skipped steps
4. **Check if the audio players are created** successfully
5. **Verify the play method is called** and returns success

The enhanced logging will show exactly where the drop sound process fails, allowing us to pinpoint and fix the specific issue.
