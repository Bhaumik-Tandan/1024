# iOS Folder Cleanup

## Summary
Removed the empty `ios/` folder from the project as it was not needed for the current Expo managed workflow setup.

## Date
December 2024

## Reason for Removal
- The `ios/` folder was empty and contained no files
- Project uses Expo managed workflow (evident from package.json scripts)
- No custom native iOS code or modules are required
- iOS configuration is properly handled in `app.json`
- The folder can be regenerated later if needed with `expo run:ios`

## Impact
- No functional impact on the application
- Cleaner project structure
- Removes unnecessary empty directory
- Maintains all iOS-specific configuration in `app.json`

## Future Considerations
If the project needs to be ejected from Expo managed workflow or requires custom native iOS modules, the `ios/` folder can be regenerated using:
```bash
expo run:ios
```
